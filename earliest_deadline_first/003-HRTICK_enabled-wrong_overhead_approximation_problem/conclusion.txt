As can be seen in row 259, 275, 287, 296, 317, 329, 340 and finally
350 to 383 of execution_trace_processed.ods, the wrong overhead
approximation, which is too low, causes a cascaded deadline
postponement with shrinking c_s. So, eventually Task 2 misses its
deadline. This problem does not lie in SCHED_DEADLINE but in the
experimentation unit itself.
