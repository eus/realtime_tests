A .cfg file consists of sub-experiment specifications. One
specification is expressed as one line. A specification can be
commented out by starting the line with the character `#'. A blank
line is ignored.

A specification starts with a program ID which can be one of the
following:
SERVER (the program executable is server)
CLIENT (the program executable is client)
CPU_HOG (the program executable is cpu_hog)
CPU_HOG_CBS (the program executable is cpu_hog_cbs)
HRT_CBS (the program executable is hrt_cbs)
SERVER_CLIENT (the program executable is server)

After specifying the program ID, a specification should continue with
the mandatory command line options and arguments required by the
program. The mandatory command line options and arguments can be
obtained by running the program executable with -h option.

Please keep in mind that arguments given to a command line option must
not contain any whitespace. Moreover, special for CLIENT and HRT_CBS
program ID is that their command line option -x will be forced to have
the DURATION value specified to executable main using command line
option -t.

Moreover, the order of specifying the specification _does_ matter as
explained below to create a specific chain of communication hierarchy.

Special for CLIENT program ID, if it comes after a SERVER program ID,
the option -v will be forced to have the value of the preceding SERVER
PID. To have a client process that is not associated with any
specified server process, specify the CLIENT program ID before any
SERVER program ID.

Special for SERVER_CLIENT program ID, it must come after a SERVER
program ID or a SERVER_CLIENT program ID to create a nested blocking
chain.
